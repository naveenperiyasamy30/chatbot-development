## Projects

### 1. Plain Frontend and API
- Built using **HTML, CSS, and JS** (Tailwind CSS for styling).  
- Connected directly to the [DeepSeek Chat v3.1 (Free)](https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free).  
- **Note:** API key is kept in frontend only for testing. This is **not safe** in real projects.  
- Purpose: To understand how APIs work and how frontend communicates with backend services.  
- **Limitation:** The DeepSeek free API can be **slow sometimes**, but I am using it only for learning and practice.

### 2. React-Based Chatbot
- Rebuilt the chatbot using **React** for better structure and reusability.  
- Learned about **components, state, and props**.  
- Still uses the same [DeepSeek Chat v3.1 (Free)](https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free).  
- API key is in frontend for learning purposes.  
- Purpose: To practice React fundamentals and API integration.

### 3. Spring Boot Secure Chatbot
- Backend built with **Spring Boot** to handle API requests securely.  
- Frontend connects to backend instead of calling API directly.  
- API key is stored securely in backend environment variables.  
- Purpose: To learn **full-stack development** and proper API key management.
